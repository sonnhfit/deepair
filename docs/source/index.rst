Welcome to Deepair's documentation!
===================================

**Deepair** (/diÀêp er/) is a Python library that have reliable implementations of Deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

Simple way to start
-------------------
Install deepair with pip

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install deepair

start with gym env

.. code-block:: python

   import gym
   from deepair.dqn import Rainbow

   env = gym.make('LunarLander-v2')

   rain = Rainbow(env=env, memory_size=10000, batch_size=32, target_update=256)

   rain.train(timesteps=200000)

   # test
   state = env.reset()
   done = False
   score = 0

   while not done:
      action = rain.select_action(state, deterministic=True)
      next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)

      state = next_state
      score += reward

   print("score: ", score)
